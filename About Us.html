 <p>A national garden and premier horticultural attraction for local and international visitors, Gardens by the Bay is a showpiece of horticulture and garden artistry that presents the plant kingdom in a whole new way, entertaining while educating visitors with plants seldom seen in this part of the world, ranging from species in cool, temperate climates to tropical forests and habitats.</p>

  <p>Gardens by the Bay is an independent organisation responsible for developing and managing one of Asiaâ€™s foremost garden destinations.

The Gardens is led by a multidisciplinary team of professionals who have been involved in the greening of Singapore and had worked alongside international and local experts to develop the Gardens. It has an in-house team of skilled landscape designers, horticulturists, arborists, engineers, plant health, garden and turf management experts, as well as plant research and orchid breeding professionals, who leverage on the extensive global network of plant sources cultivated during the development days, to continuously curate and grow the Gardens.</p>
